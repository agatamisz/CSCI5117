Question:
If we are going to do a mobile app are we going to make an web app or a android, ios, or windows phone app?


So the geospatial control point game that Steve was pitching reminded me of this game http://www.nianticproject.com/ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress&hl=en
I think we can definitely do a novel flavor of that type of game but let's be careful not to bite off more than we can chew.



Idea: free meter
An app that lets you upload a pin when you leave a space that you had to pay money for without using all the time alloted
The app would only have to consist of a web map and a server to hangle push/pulls with people adding pins and asking for the current list of them
The server would also have to go through the pinds every few seconds to delete the expired ones.
Additions could be adding a layer to show when certain roads become free to park on and the rates on other roads.

If webapp version could be a dynamic map layer that shows what streets are free to park when, eg when meters become free
eg
                         -|         |-  
--------------------------+         +------------------------------------------------------------
                           <-street->
  spot region A (freein 45min (6:30pm))    |    spot region B never free (24hr) |\      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
could make a polygon layer for the streets that are chunked out into the different classes and use cartoCSS to add dynamic styling based on current time

Update:
I found some apps that provide a similar service to this. I think the idea that Chris had for letting users know how much time is left on a meter is
novel.

Idea: game
Since it only has to be an interactive app we could literally create any kind of game, it might not even have to be multiplayer.

Idea: Forest Stewardship Plan Data Portal
This idea is not novel, but it is useful. Given that we had the opportunity to do the brown fields project, which was of the same vein, I think it might be allowable. My program at work would use this as a mock up for how we want our web portal designed, and would probably end up using a lot of the code.
The project would be to create a data portal for forest stewardship plans. I would publish the data on the DNRs AGOL server. It would not contain any non-public data, so security would not be a big issue. We would be able to do all of the HTML on one of our UMN webspaces.
The portal would display the data and allow for user friendly queries for novice computer users. Search by landowner name and zoom to the polygon, show the attributes for that polygon, that kind of thing. That would be the baseline.
We could expand the project by developing user account management. Authentication would have to be functional, but not robust. The point would be to create the html/css/javascript for the pages and get it working, not to keep out hackers.
Another possible expansion would be to create an admin dashboard for managing user accounts. 
So... boring, not novel, but useful and easily scoped.

Idea: Ask a Stranger
Not sure if this has been done before, but how about an app where users who are logged in could ask questions to a subset of the larger app-using community that is within a particular distance from the user? 
This way, if you are for instance visiting a place you don't know well and get lost or are looking for a particular destination, you could make a quick ask and people nearby would answer.
Kind of like a proximity-based group chat.
This could also be used to ask strangers to participate in random activities with you, like grab a coffee if you just want someone to hang out with, or ask for a spontaneous hug/high-five.
Also, it could be used as a citizen-based security system, where if you are in a scetchy situation you could let people around you know.
Biggest drawback in my mind is that most people wouldn't want random people's chats coming to them just because they are nearby. Not sure how to work around that, maybe a ranking system.
Again, I haven't looked into whether or not this type of thing exists, but it seems too straightforward to have not been done before.

Idea: Color Blindness Tester App
This idea stems from our cartography discussion on color choices and color blidness. Coblis (http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)
is a website that allows a user to uplod a photo to the site and test to see how it looks with different Color Vision 
Deficiencies (CVD). This app would bring this capability to mobile devices (Android). A user would turn on the app which
uses the phone's camera and then would be able to toggle between different CVDs. The screen would adjust to show what 
a viewer would see.
