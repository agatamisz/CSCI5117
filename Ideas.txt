Question:
If we are going to do a mobile app are we going to make an web app or a android, ios, or windows phone app?


So the geospatial control point game that Steve was pitching reminded me of this game http://www.nianticproject.com/ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress&hl=en
I think we can definitely do a novel flavor of that type of game but let's be careful not to bite off more than we can chew.



Idea: free meter
An app that lets you upload a pin when you leave a space that you had to pay money for without using all the time alloted
The app would only have to consist of a web map and a server to hangle push/pulls with people adding pins and asking for the current list of them
The server would also have to go through the pinds every few seconds to delete the expired ones.
Additions could be adding a layer to show when certain roads become free to park on and the rates on other roads.

Idea: game
Since it only has to be an interactive app we could literally create any kind of game, it might not even have to be multiplayer.
